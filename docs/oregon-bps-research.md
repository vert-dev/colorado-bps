# Oregon Building Performance Standard (BPS) Research

**Research Date**: November 6, 2025
**Purpose**: Document Oregon BPS regulations for Washington CBPS → Oregon BPS migration

---

## Executive Summary

Oregon's Building Performance Standard (BPS) was established by **House Bill 3409 in 2023** and became effective **January 1, 2025**. The program is administered by the Oregon Department of Energy (ODOE) and is based on **ASHRAE Standard 100-2024 with Oregon-specific amendments**.

**Key Differences from Washington CBPS**:
- Oregon uses a two-tier system (Tier 1 & Tier 2) with different requirements
- Coverage starts at **20,000 sq ft** (vs Washington's 50k sqft threshold)
- Compliance dates range from **June 1, 2028 to July 1, 2030**
- Penalties capped at **$5,000 + $1/sqft/year** (vs Washington's annual structure)
- State incentive program: **$2M for early compliance**, **$12M CERTA grant for implementation**

## Compliance Tiers Explained

### Tier Structure Philosophy
Oregon's system differs from Washington's clear "Tier 1 vs Tier 2" based solely on size:

**Tier 1 (Large Nonresidential)**:
- Focuses on largest commercial buildings
- Performance-based requirements (must meet targets)
- Phased by building size (200k+, 90-200k, 35-90k)
- Requires operational documentation and energy audits if non-compliant

**Tier 2 (Smaller Commercial + All Multifamily/Institutional)**:
- Includes smaller commercial (20-35k sqft)
- ALL multifamily, hospitals, schools, universities ≥35k sqft
- Data reporting only (no performance targets yet)
- Future standards to be established by 2030

### Grouped Buildings & Campuses
Buildings that share energy metering OR are part of the same complex can report as a group:
- Reduces paperwork
- May allow "extended Tier 2 status" for buildings in same complex as special Tier 2 buildings
- Must still comply with BPS requirements

---

## Deadlines and Timeline

### Regular Compliance Deadlines

**Tier 1**:
- **June 1, 2028**: Buildings ≥200,000 sq ft
- **June 1, 2029**: Buildings 90,000-199,999 sq ft
- **June 1, 2030**: Buildings 35,000-89,999 sq ft

**Tier 2**:
- **July 1, 2028**: All Tier 2 buildings (first report)
- **Every 5 years thereafter**: Ongoing reporting

### Early Compliance Deadlines (For Incentives)

**Tier 1**:
- **June 1, 2027**: Buildings ≥200,000 sq ft (1 year early)
- **June 1, 2028**: Buildings 90,000-199,999 sq ft (1 year early)
- **June 1, 2029**: Buildings 35,000-89,999 sq ft (1 year early)

**Tier 2**:
- **July 1, 2027**: All Tier 2 buildings (1 year early)

### Critical Pre-Deadline Actions

**For Tier 1 buildings NOT meeting EUIt**:
- Must notify ODOE **at least 180 days before compliance date**
- Must complete energy audit **before compliance date**
- Must develop implementation plan by compliance date

---

## Penalties and Enforcement

### Penalty Structure

**Who is Subject to Penalties**:
- Only Tier 1 buildings
- Tier 2 buildings are NOT subject to penalties (reporting only)

**Maximum Penalties**:
- **Base**: Up to $5,000 per violation
- **Plus**: $1.00 per square foot of Gross Floor Area per year for continuing violations
- **Per Compliance Period**: New penalties may be assessed for each period

### Enforcement Process

**Step 1: Notice of Violation and Opportunity to Correct (NOVC)**
- Issued after failure to submit required documentation by scheduled date
- Specifies which reports are needed
- Provides at least 7 days to reach compliance

**Step 2: Notice of Violation and Intent to Assess Civil Penalties (NOVI)**
- Issued if owner fails to comply with NOVC
- Describes penalty calculations
- Owner has 30 days to respond

**Step 3: Response Options**
Owner can respond by:
1. Submitting compliance documents
2. Submitting noncompliance mitigation plan (reduces penalties to max 30% of $5,000 + $0.20/sqft/year)
3. Submitting exemption application
4. Requesting hearing to challenge/mitigate penalties
5. Paying civil penalties without pursuing compliance

**Step 4: Payment**
- Penalties due within 30 days of assessment
- Interest and late fees accrue after 180 days (but cap still applies)

### Comparison to Washington CBPS Penalties

| Jurisdiction | Daily Fine | Annual Cap | Structure |
|-------------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Washington** | $2,000-$4,000 non-submittal<br>Up to $5,000 + $1/sqft/year performance violations | Variable by building size | Annual penalties |
| **Oregon** | N/A (per period, not daily) | $5,000 + $1/sqft/year | Per compliance period |
| **Boston BERDO** | $150-$1,000/day | Variable | Daily cumulative |

**Key Insight**: Oregon's penalties are **less severe than Boston's daily structure** but similar cap to Washington. Enforcement is **per compliance period** rather than daily or annual.

## Branding Guidance

### Oregon State Colors (Official)
- **Navy Blue and Gold** (designated 1959 as official state colors)
- Colors from Oregon state flag

### Recommended Color Palette

**Primary**: Navy Blue
- Use for headers, primary buttons, navigation
- Professional, governmental feel
- Matches Oregon state identity

**Secondary**: Gold
- Use for accents, CTAs, highlights
- Complementary to Navy Blue
- Vibrant, attention-grabbing

**Color Codes**:
- Navy Blue: #002B5C (approximate, verify with Oregon flag specs)
- Gold: #FFD700 or #FDB515 (University of Oregon uses PMS 107)

**WCAG AA Compliance**:
- Navy Blue text on white: ✅ Pass
- Gold text requires dark backgrounds for accessibility
- Test all combinations for 4.5:1 contrast ratio

## Calculator Strategy Recommendation

### Analysis
Oregon BPS differs significantly from Washington CBPS:

**Washington CBPS**:
- Clear cost model based on building type, age, existing systems
- EMP and O&M program costs relatively standard
- Tier 2 incentives can cover 100% of costs

**Oregon BPS**:
- EUI-based system (weather-normalized energy intensity)
- Performance targets vary by building type and activity
- Costs depend on gap between building EUI and EUIt
- Energy audit + LCCA required for Tier 1 non-compliant buildings
- Significantly different calculation methodology

### Recommendation: **SHELVE CALCULATOR** (Boston Approach)

**Reasons**:
1. **Different compliance model**: Oregon uses EUI/EUIt comparison vs Washington's EMP/O&M focus
2. **Unknown cost factors**: Costs depend on audit findings and energy gap, not easily calculable upfront
3. **Complex tier system**: Mixed Tier 2 (commercial + institutional) requires different logic
4. **Limited data available**: Oregon program just launched Jan 2025, cost benchmarks not established
5. **Time constraints**: Boston completed migration in similar timeframe by shelving calculator

**Implementation**:
- Move `/calculator` route to `.future/calculator/`
- Create `.future/README.md` explaining Oregon-specific requirements needed
- Update homepage to remove calculator CTA, focus on consultation booking
- Document what research/data needed for future reactivation

**Alternative**: Simple compliance checker (tier determination + deadline lookup) without cost estimation

## Integration Requirements

### HubSpot Calendars
- **Current (Washington)**: dheppner calendar for Washington compliance
- **Need from client**:
  - Oregon sales rep calendar URLs
  - Routing logic (still 1-2 buildings → Dylan, 3+ → Kevin?)
  - Or single Oregon-specific calendar?

### Zapier Webhook
- **Current (Washington)**: `https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/885017/uhzbn5c/`
- **Recommendation**: Request NEW webhook for Oregon leads to separate CRM pipelines
- **Fallback**: Can use same webhook initially if client prefers unified lead management

### Analytics
- **GTM**: May need Oregon-specific container or keep Washington GTM
- **LogRocket**: Likely keep same project for Vert portfolio
- **Lucky Orange**: Check if separate site tracking needed
- **Vercel**: Auto-tracks per deployment

---

## Domain Configuration

**Target Domain**: `or-bps.com` (confirmed by user)

**DNS Setup**:
- Verify domain registered and accessible
- Point to Vercel deployment
- Configure SSL certificate (auto via Vercel)

---

## Key Uncertainties / Questions for Client

1. **Lead Routing**: Same Dylan/Kevin 1-2 vs 3+ logic, or different for Oregon?
2. **Zapier Integration**: New webhook or reuse Washington's?
3. **Analytics**: Separate GTM container or shared tracking?
4. **Pricing**: Should Oregon pricing differ from Washington? (Research needed)
5. **Calculator**: Confirm shelving approach vs attempting adaptation?
6. **Brand Assets**: Any Oregon-specific imagery beyond logo?
