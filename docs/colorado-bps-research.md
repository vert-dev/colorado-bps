# Colorado BPS Research Document

**Purpose**: Document Colorado BPS regulations for Oregon BPS → Colorado BPS migration
**Date**: November 6, 2025
**Primary Law**: HB 21-1286 (2021) - Energy Performance for Buildings
**Source**: Colorado Energy Office

## Executive Summary

Colorado's Building Performance Standard (HB 21-1286) requires buildings ≥50,000 sq ft to:
1. **Benchmark annually** (starting 2022)
2. **Meet performance targets** by 2026 (interim) and 2030 (final)
3. **Choose compliance pathway** (Energy Efficiency, GHG Reduction, or Standard % Reduction)

**Key Difference from Oregon**: Colorado is **emissions-focused** with multiple compliance pathways, vs Oregon's single EUI performance model.

## Building Coverage

### Size Threshold
- **≥50,000 sq ft**: All building types covered (commercial, institutional, residential)
- **No tier structure**: Single threshold, but multiple compliance pathways

### Exemptions
(To be confirmed from official Colorado Energy Office sources)

## Key Deadlines

### Benchmarking Deadlines
| Date | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **June 1, 2023** | 2022 benchmarking data due |
| **June 1, 2024** | 2023 benchmarking data due |
| **August 1, 2024** | Annual benchmarking reports due (current year) |
| **Annually thereafter** | August 1 each year |

### Performance Standard Deadlines
| Date | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **December 31, 2025** | Energy audit + compliance plan + pathway selection |
| **December 31, 2026** | Meet interim EUI/GHG targets (7% reduction) |
| **June 1, 2027** | Monthly interim target penalties begin if non-compliant |
| **December 31, 2030** | Meet final EUI/GHG targets (20% reduction) |
| **June 1, 2031** | Monthly final target penalties begin if non-compliant |

## Penalties

### Benchmarking Non-Compliance
- **First occurrence**: $500 fine
- **Subsequent occurrences**: $2,000 per occurrence
- **Enforcement began**: January 1, 2024

### Performance Standard Non-Compliance
- **Interim target penalties**: Begin June 1, 2027 (monthly)
- **Final target penalties**: Begin June 1, 2031 (monthly)
- **Amount**: To be determined based on degree of non-compliance

### Annual Fee
- **$100 per covered building per year** (benchmarking program fee)

## Compliance Pathways

Colorado offers **3 compliance pathways** (building owner choice):

### 1. Energy Efficiency Pathway (Default)
- **Goal**: Reduce building energy use (Site EUI)
- **Interim Target (2026)**: 7% reduction from 2021 baseline
- **Final Target (2030)**: 20% reduction from 2021 baseline
- **Method**: Energy efficiency measures, equipment upgrades
- **Best for**: Most buildings, traditional efficiency improvements

### 2. GHG Reduction Pathway
- **Goal**: Reduce greenhouse gas emissions
- **Interim Target (2026)**: 7% GHG reduction
- **Final Target (2030)**: 20% GHG reduction
- **Method**: Electrification, renewable energy, RECs
- **Best for**: Buildings with electrification/renewable plans

### 3. Standard % Reduction Pathway
- **Goal**: Fixed percentage reductions regardless of building type
- **Interim (2026-2029)**: 13% reduction
- **Final (2030-2050)**: 29% reduction
- **Trigger**: Only available if 2021 baseline EUI is >29% above assigned target
- **Best for**: Buildings that significantly exceed targets

### Pathway Selection
- Must be selected by **December 31, 2025**
- Can be changed in future compliance cycles
- Selection form submitted through Building Owner Portal

## Compliance Model

### Baseline Year
- **2021**: Energy use baseline established

### Performance Metrics
- **Site EUI** (Energy Use Intensity): kBtu/sqft/year
- **GHGI** (Greenhouse Gas Intensity): kg CO2e/sqft/year
- Targets vary by property type (see Appendix A of Technical Resource Guide)

### Required Steps
1. **Benchmark** in Energy Star Portfolio Manager
2. **Connect** ESPM to Colorado's BEAM Portal via Web Services
3. **Submit** annual benchmarking report + $100 fee
4. **Identify** current Site EUI from Building Owner Portal reports
5. **Select** compliance pathway by Dec 31, 2025
6. **Complete** energy audit by Dec 31, 2025
7. **Implement** energy/emissions reduction measures
8. **Verify** compliance through annual reporting

## Incentives & Support Programs

### State Programs
- **Colorado Energy Office Technical Assistance**
- Building Owner Portal with customized compliance reports
- Technical Resource Guides
- Help Desk support

### Utility Programs
(To be researched: Xcel Energy, Black Hills Energy, others)

### Federal Programs
- **IRA Tax Credits**: 179D (up to $5/sqft), 45L
- **CERTA Grants**: If applicable

**Note**: Colorado appears to have less state grant funding compared to Oregon's ECAPP/BERI programs.

## Key Differences from Oregon BPS

| Factor | Oregon BPS | Colorado BPS |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **Primary Law** | HB 3409 (2023) | HB 21-1286 (2021) |
| **Size Threshold** | Tier 1: ≥35k sqft commercial<br>Tier 2: 20-35k + all institutional | Single: ≥50k sqft all types |
| **Tier Structure** | 2 tiers (performance + reporting) | No tiers (single pathway choice) |
| **Compliance Model** | EUI vs EUIt targets | 3 pathways (EUI, GHG, % reduction) |
| **Baseline Year** | Not specified (varies) | 2021 fixed baseline |
| **Interim Deadline** | June 2028-2030 (by size) | December 31, 2026 |
| **Final Deadline** | Same as interim | December 31, 2030 |
| **Penalties** | $5,000 + $1/sqft annually | Monthly penalties (amount TBD) |
| **Benchmarking Fee** | Not mentioned | $100/building annually |
| **Incentives** | ECAPP $2M + BERI $12M | Limited state funding, utility programs |
| **Enforcement** | Oregon DEQ + ODOE | Colorado Energy Office |

## Migration Challenges

### High Complexity Items
1. **Multiple Compliance Pathways**: Need to explain 3 different pathways clearly
2. **Baseline Year**: 2021 fixed (vs Oregon's rolling baseline)
3. **Monthly Penalties**: Different structure than Oregon's annual penalties
4. **Benchmarking + Performance**: Two separate but related requirements
5. **Lower Incentive Funding**: No major state grant programs like Oregon

### Medium Complexity Items
1. **50k sqft threshold**: Simpler than Oregon's tiered approach
2. **Pathway Selection Process**: New concept not in Oregon/Washington/Boston
3. **BEAM Portal Integration**: Colorado-specific platform

### Migration Strategy
- Emphasize pathway selection as unique value proposition
- Focus on 2025 audit/plan deadline as immediate action item
- Clarify difference between benchmarking ($100 fee) vs performance standards
- Highlight federal IRA tax credits since state funding is limited

## Brand Colors (Colorado Energy Office)

**Note**: Colorado's official BPS branding uses:
- Red/Yellow/Blue mountain logo (Colorado Energy Office)
- May need to create custom Colorado BPS color scheme

**Recommended Colorado BPS Brand Colors**:
- **Primary**: Colorado Blue (#003087) - from state flag
- **Secondary**: Colorado Gold (#FFB81C) - from state flag
- **Accent**: Colorado Red (#C8102E) - from state flag

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Research complete - documented above
2. ⏳ Copy Oregon BPS repo to colorado-bps
3. ⏳ Update brand colors (blue/gold/red Colorado theme)
4. ⏳ Replace Oregon content with Colorado content
5. ⏳ Update calculator for Colorado's 3-pathway model
6. ⏳ Update all components for Colorado regulations

## Questions for Clarification

1. Exact monthly penalty amounts for performance non-compliance?
2. Specific exemptions (government, affordable housing, etc.)?
3. Available utility incentive programs by provider?
4. Timeline adjustment process details?
5. Official Colorado BPS logo/branding guidelines?
